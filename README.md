Summary and Reflections Report from Project Two

**Reflection**
**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
To ensure functionality and security, I apply a thorough testing strategy that includes unit testing, integration testing, and validation against user requirements. I also follow secure coding practices, such as input validation and careful handling of sensitive data, to minimize vulnerabilities.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
I interpret user needs by carefully analyzing project requirements, asking clarifying questions when necessary, and translating those needs into technical specifications. Throughout the development process, I continuously refer back to the original requirements to ensure the final program meets user expectations.

**How do I approach designing software?**
I approach software design by breaking down problems into smaller components, considering both functionality and maintainability. I use object-oriented principles to create modular, reusable, and testable code. Planning before coding helps me create systems that are easier to expand and debug.
